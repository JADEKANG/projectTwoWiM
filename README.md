# Project 2: Words in Motion
by Jade Kang

## project overview
This project expresses the idea of community through a dynamic and interactive engagement with written language. 

<br>
For me, "community" has a complex meaning. <br> <br>
It feels like both a companion and a gateway to adventure. When I think about my daily life, I remember moments primarily through the people I was with. So, when I look back on my memories, it's not the place or atmosphere that comes to mind first, but rather the people I shared those moments with. <br> <br>

That’s why "community" holds a special meaning for me. I believe that the groups I belonged to at different times in my life reflect who I was during those periods. Perhaps that’s also why I prefer the word "reminiscence" over "memory."

<br>
I completed this project using lyrics from Lauv’s song *Never Not*, which reminds me of these meanings. I selected parts of the lyrics that convey the preciousness of spending time with others, and I designed the project to align with the emotions and atmosphere of the song. Specifically, drawing from my personal experience of hearing this song live at one of their concerts, I incorporated the image of a "sunset" towards the end to reflect that moment.
